## üì¶ Installation

For a default configuration:

```lua
{
  "rlychrisg/truncateline.nvim",
  -- NOTE: these keybinds are not set by default and will need to be set
  -- either here, or wherever you set your keybinds.
  keys = {
      {
          "<leader>l", ":TemporaryToggle<CR>",
          { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = "TruncateLine temporary toggle" },
      },

      {
          "<leader>sl", ":ToggleTruncate<CR>",
          { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = "TruncateLine toggle" },
      },
  },
  opts = {
    enabled_on_start = true,

    -- this will be appended to the virtual text to distinguish it from the actual text
    -- to disable this behaviour, set truncate_str to ""
    truncate_str = "...",

    -- how many characters from the start of the line should be displayed
    -- Note: you might want the total of this setting,
    -- along with truncate_str, to be less than your sidescrolloff
    -- setting, to prevent obscuring text.
    line_start_length = 8,

    -- time for in ms for a temporary toggle
    temporary_toggle_dur = 2000,

    -- which highlight group should be used for virtual text.
    -- "Comment", or "Normal" are good choices, but anything in
    -- :highlight can be used.
    hilight_group = "Comment",
  },
},
```
